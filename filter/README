Debugging.
Checked lpfilter. Working
Checked hpfilter. Not working
### Bug fixed : wrong assignment to buffer pointer in hpfilt() function

Checked complete filter. Working

Checking peak() function. Not working
### Bug fixed : some optimizations wronged the functional equivalence to if else structure. 
Checked peak() function. Now working
Checked newPeak calculation. Slight modifications. Working.

Checking blsCheck.
### Bug Fixed : output needs to be inverted
Now working

Checked QRS detection without search back. Working

Checking with search back. Using physionet database records {100,101,102,103}
2 extra peaks recorded. Line #2460-61 and #7560-61
My implementation not working.

###Bug Fixed : meanCalc() function. Limits to loop for summing and index increment corrected.
###Bug Fixed : qrs, rr, noise buffers are reverse circularly updated. The way in which first 8 beats come affects if implementation is normal circular vs reverse circular

Checked with Search Back. Working

Beat Detection is ok but it is generating segmentation fault after a very long stream for some unknown reason. The point at which segmentation fault is being generated is not at all unusual. Its at a beat detected in usual manner and not in searchback

Changing scope of variables. Segmentation fault avoided. 
Checked without search back. Working. Small mistake in noise buffer updation, wrong size value passed. Corrected.

S/W check done. Working.
Hardware generation bug still exists
