Debugging.
Checked lpfilter. Working
Checked hpfilter. Not working
### Bug fixed : wrong assignment to buffer pointer in hpfilt() function

Checked complete filter. Working

Checking peak() function. Not working
### Bug fixed : some optimizations wronged the functional equivalence to if else structure. 
Checked peak() function. Now working
Checked newPeak calculation. Slight modifications. Working.

Checking blsCheck.
### Bug Fixed : output needs to be inverted
Now working

Checked QRS detection without search back. Working

Checking with search back. Using physionet database records {100,101,102,103}
2 extra peaks recorded. Line #2460-61 and #7560-61
My implementation not working.

###Bug Fixed : meanCalc() function. Limits to loop for summing and index increment corrected.
###Bug Fixed : qrs, rr, noise buffers are reverse circularly updated. The way in which first 8 beats come affects if implementation is normal circular vs reverse circular

Checked with Search Back. Working

Hardware generation bug fixed. Mempool issue with pointer arguments.

H/W debugging.
Working on simulations currently.

Bug #1 : WINbuff not initialized before read access.
Status : fixed.

filter checked in H/W. Working correctly.
Detector yet to be verified.

without search back and without threshold adaptation to blank no detection periods.
failing. Bound check failed.

checking the qmean in first loop which runs for first 8 seconds. That is running ok.
Bound check still failing. Reason unknown
