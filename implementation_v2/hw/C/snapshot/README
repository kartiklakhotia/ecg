	The software model of the whole chain.

	include/
		data structures

	src/	
		source code of ECG chain

	driver/
		source code of testbench for ECG
		chain.

	To compile
		./compile_sw_driver.sh
			(note AHIR must be set up)

	This produces an executable 
		bin/test_best_fit_sw

	The executable takes 3 arguments

		moving-average-filter order 
			keep it 32  for now.

		filter coefficient file
			../filter/tfilter...txt
	
		ecg sample data file
			../data/mlii.txt for example

	and prints the fits to stdout.  Also generates
	lots of useful info to stderr.  See ../observations/run.sw.log
	for a run log.

	You could run this as

	./test_best_fit_sw 32 ../filter/tfilter2.i16.2.dc.txt ../data/mlii.txt 2>&1 | tee run.sw.log



	In the run.sw.log file, you can see the following information
		
		BPF:   band-pass results
		DER:   derivative filter results.
		MAR:   moving average results.
		QRS:   QRS peak results
		FIT:   best fits with beat information.
		
	and lots of other information.
