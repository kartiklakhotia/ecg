To run the software model, you can use the executable


	./bin/test_best_fit_sw 


The program is invoked with the following arguments
	./bin/test_best_fit_sw  <moving-average-filter-order>  <bandpass-filter-coeffs>  <data-file>

We keep the moving-average-filter order at 32, use filter/tfilter2.i16.2.dc.txt as the filter
file, and for the data-set, use one of the files in the data/ directory.


For example

	./bin/test_best_fit_sw 32 filter/tfilter2.i16.2.dc.txt data/mlii.txt  


This produces a big log file which gives intermediate results as well as the
final fit coefficients for the beats.  To save the log file, run the 
example as 

	./bin/test_best_fit_sw 32 filter/tfilter2.i16.2.dc.txt data/mlii.txt   2>&1 | tee run.sw.log


and to see the fits

	grep "FIT:" run.sw.log

You can also examine post band-pass-filter samples

	grep "BPF:" run.sw.log

or post moving-average

	grep "MAR:" run.sw.log

or post derivative filter

	grep "DER:" run.sw.log
