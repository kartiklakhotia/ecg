You will need to have AHIR installed to build
things.

0.  Go to the AHIR release area and 

	source ahir_bashrc

1.  Come back to this directory.

2.  Build the software test setup 

	./build_sw_only.sh

    Check out the software model, using
    the check_sw.sh script in the C/
    directory.

3.a To build the VHDL simulation option for
     the normal hardware (no clock gating).

    Run 

	./build_vhdlsim_only.sh 

    and follow the instructions in C/README.VHDLSIM
    file to perform the VHDL simulation.

3.b To build the VHDL simulation option for
     the hardware with clock gating.

    Run 

	./build_vhdlsim_only.gated_clock.sh 

    and follow the instructions in C/README.VHDLSIM
    file.

4.  Build the hardware setup:
	Open the build_all.sh and edit the options
	in that file as indicated.

	Then run

	./build_all.sh
