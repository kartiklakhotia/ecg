changed the order in which nested loops are traversed. It now goes over all nsigmas for a single data point.
Done.

Now unrolling the loop in this one.
Unrolled 4 times. Working. Time consumed = 0.44ms average

Created threads for computing MSE and inner products. Both run in parallel now.
Software check Done. Working

Hardware Check -> done. Timing improvement from 0.57ms to 0.44ms. Expected better results. Find out the bottleneck.
