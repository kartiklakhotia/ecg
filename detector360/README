Sampling frequency = 360Hz
Floats used for only lhp filtering;
which essentially passes the data 
forth to Hermite Coefficient Calculator.

Tested the Detector and Verified working.
Beats detected are at exactly same location
and exactly same in number as the 100.annt 
states.

Adding the bestfit function as a thread
listening to output of detector. Modified 
testbench accordingly to send input samples
and parallely listen to output of bestfit 
function.

Beats getting detected correctly but LHP 
output data is not as expected. It is much flatter
and doesn't resemble the OneBeat.data at all.

Include Derivative in the data being checked and
remove Derivative delay from QRSdelay
Post derivative is actually worse.
